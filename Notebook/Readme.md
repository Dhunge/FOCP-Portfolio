# Python Weekly Assignment Portfolio
# Week 1: Fundamentals & Arithmetic
File: Week1/Tasks.py

Basic Syntax: Executed initial scripts using standard output functions.

Arithmetic Operations: Performed calculations using operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents.

Precedence: Applied parentheses to manipulate the order of mathematical operations.

Exception Handling: Implemented try/except blocks to manage runtime errors, such as division by zero.

# Week 2: Variables & Data Management
File: Week2/Tasks.py

Variable Assignment: Practiced initializing and updating variables to store values.

Primitive Types: worked with core data types including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.

Type Inspection: Utilized the type() function to verify and identify data classes.

# Week 3: Control Flow & Iteration
Files: Week3/

Conditional Logic: Employed comparison operators and if/elif/else statements to direct program flow based on conditions.

Loops: implemented for loops for definite iteration and while loops for indefinite iteration.

Loop Control: utilized break and continue keywords to modify loop execution behavior.

# Week 4: Standard Library & Imports
Files: Week4/

Module Usage: Integrated external functionality by importing the standard math module.

Selective Imports: Practiced importing specific functions (e.g., sqrt) to optimize code.

Advanced Math: Applied complex mathematical functions like logarithms and Pi in practical tasks.

# Week 5: Modular Programming
Files: Week5/

Function Definition: Created custom, reusable functions using the def keyword.

Documentation: Wrote docstrings to document function purpose and parameters.

Code Reusability: Demonstrated how to import and utilize custom-written functions across different files.

# Week 6: List Manipulation
File: Week6/Tasks.py

List Structures: managed collections of items using Python lists.

Insertion: Used methods like append() and extend() to populate lists dynamically.

Deletion: Removed elements by value (remove) or index (pop).

Organization: Applied sorting algorithms to arrange data alphabetically or numerically.

# Week 7: Sets & Set Operations
File: Week7/Tasks.py

Unique Collections: Utilized Sets to store unordered, unique elements.

Mathematical Operations: Applied set theory concepts programmatically:

Union: Merging unique elements.

Intersection: Identifying overlapping elements.

Difference: Isolating unique elements in one set vs. another.

# Week 8: File I/O & String Formatting
File: Week8/Tasks.py

String Formatting: Implemented f-strings for efficient and readable variable interpolation.

File Output: Wrote scripts to create and modify text files (w mode).

File Input: Developed scripts to access and read external file content (r mode).
